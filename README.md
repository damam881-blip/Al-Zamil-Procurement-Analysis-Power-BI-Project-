### 💡 Key Features & Dashboard Pages

I didn't just build charts — I built a multi-page, fully interactive system designed to answer real business questions through advanced logic and user-focused design.

#### 1. Overview Page: The Executive Compass 🧭
Provides an executive summary of the market size.
* Tracks Total Tender Value (~3M)
* Total Contract Count (59)
* Number of Agencies and Suppliers
* Immediately identifies the most active government clients by volume.

#### 2. Analysis of Government Agencies: The Financial Treasure Map 💰
This page reveals how the money is spent, identifying the highest spenders (Treemap) and comparing agency behavior based on total value vs. average contract value.

#### 3. Suppliers Analysis: The Competition Arena 🏆
A deep dive into the competition.
* Reveals the Most Winning Supplier and their market share (e.g., 50%).
* Ranks suppliers based on the average value of contracts won to clarify who secures the most profitable deals.

#### 4. Timeline Analysis: Seasonal Forecasting 🗓️
This page tells *when* to act. Line charts display seasonal trends in both tender value and volume, highlighting peak periods (e.g., March and September) crucial for resource planning.

#### 5. Table Filters: The Private Investigator 🔎
For quick auditing and verification, flexible filters allow users to rapidly isolate transactions based on date, value, or supplier/agency name, streamlining operational processes.
